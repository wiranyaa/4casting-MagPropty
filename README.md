4casting-MagPropty is software designed to help predict the magnetization of materials based on temperature changes. It leverages a machine learning model trained with data from atomic-level simulations conducted in Vampire software.

This software focuses on FePt (Iron-Platinum), a material renowned for its exceptional magnetic properties. FePt is widely used in magnetic storage devices, such as hard drives, due to its ability to retain strong magnetic characteristics even at nanoscale sizes and high temperatures. 

With 4casting-MagPropty, users can calculate the magnetization of FePt across a temperature range of 0–900 K by simply entering the material's thickness and diameter. The software generates results almost instantly, displaying how magnetization changes with temperature in an intuitive and easy-to-understand graph. 

What sets 4casting-MagPropty apart is its efficiency. By replacing traditional simulations with machine learning, it dramatically reduces computation time from 3 hours per simulation to just 1 second. 

This allows researchers to analyze FePt’s magnetic behavior more effectively, saving significant time and resources. Ideal for both research and development, 4casting-MagPropty offers a simple yet powerful solution for studying the magnetic properties of FePt materials.
